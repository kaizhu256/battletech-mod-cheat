 "YangsThoughts": "Tanaka apparently had success with this custom refit in the Solaris Arena as a close-range Skirmisher. He and his other teammate, Jason 'Equalizer' Yasbek were considered a favored 'Unlimited Class' team in the dueling arenas of Solaris City.\n\nThe 'Mavericks' luck ran out in a little known match that occurred on 26th May, 3027, during Solaris VII in the Steiner Stadium. Their opponents were newcomers, the 'Bad Bloods', with only 12 previous wins; the twins Angela 'Tempest' Marston and Bart 'Quasimodo' Marston from the Reaches.\n\nThe match between the 'Mavericks' and 'Bad Bloods' had a much smaller audience, but the fight was quite astonishing. Bart stated one of the stadiums moving walls snapped down and revealed Tanaka's Panther and before Tanaka could react, Bart fired a full AC/20 salvo from his HBK-4G into the other pilot's cockpit. Meanwhile Angela's Jenner was out of the fight, but he faced off against Jason Yasbek's ENF-4R and won without a scratch!",
