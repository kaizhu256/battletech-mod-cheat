Though it outgunned the earlier design and found significant acceptance within the Hegemony Armed Forces, the Galahad suffered from the same heat issues as the BattleMech it was meant to replace. With the development of the new Gauss Rifle, Mitchell Vehicles decided in 2594 to redesign the Galahad around these new weapons. The Galahad utilizes special building materials in the form of eleven tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor and Endo Steel internals. To fit the massive weapons on the Galahad, the engine was dropped to a GM 180, giving it a maximum speed of only 54 km/h, making it difficult for the 'Mech to keep up with its companions in most cases. The GLH-2D carries two massive M-7 Gauss Rifles, with two tons of ammo for each rifle. It was a showing of the powerful new weapons at the time and earned it the nickname of Gausszilla.",
