  "Details": "Built under orders from the FWL military, this Urbanmech was intended to showcase the Leagues new series of Light Gauss rifles. Politics – however – had other ideas and the project was passed onto a team that included a former Dark Shadows member who sought to turn the mech into a long range sniping platform. Under their direction, a Chameleon LPS system was incorporated into the design, along with a TAG system for target spotting. Sacrificing some armour to include the added bulk of the stealth systems, this Urbie makes a surprisingly good sniper with 3 jump jets providing the mobility it needs to move around and the LPS allowing it to sit for days at a time unnoticed, until the target walks past. The inclusion of the LPS was considered to expensive by the Chief Armour and the project was subsequently cancelled with only 3 prototypes made; all of which disappeared into the hands of SAFE.",
