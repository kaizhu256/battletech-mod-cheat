  "Details": "Farida Lamb was born on Katinka in the Aurigan Coalition, the second child of a runaway Magistracy noble and a retired MechWarrior. After Farida's mother was was compelled to return to her duties, Farida was raised exclusively by her father, who had settled down to run an arcade and general store that catered to hopeful prospectors. She grew up being trained on BattleMech simulators by her father, who incorporated the training into their lives so naturally that she never quite realized what an excellent MechWarrior and trainer he was. She despaired of his happy-go-lucky nature, but idolized her elder brother, who, like her, had inherited their mother's sober, responsible nature.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to events she never quite understood, her brother left Katinka while she was still a teen, taking her father's previously-hidden BattleMech with him. Though she wanted to follow him, that sense of responsibility kept her at her father's side. It wasn't until Espinoza's coup that her father revealed that he was perfectly capable of handling the store without her, and unleashed her on an unsuspecting Periphery.\r\n\r\nShe's spent her time since working as a mercenary, constantly striving to improve herself, constantly comparing herself to an impossible ideal. A quiet woman, more than one strutting braggart has underestimated her, sometimes to their sorrow. She never, ever argues with leadership decisions she disagrees with. If she decides a line has been crossed, she acts as she considers appropriate. She's left more than one angry mercenary commander behind.",
