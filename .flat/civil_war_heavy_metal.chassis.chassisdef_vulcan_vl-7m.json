  "Details": "The VL-7M retains the Endo Steel skeleton and fusion engine of the VL-5M. However, technicians considered its jump capacity more than sufficient for urban combat, and so reduced it to 120 meters. The weight and space saved by removing the two Jump Jets allows the design to carry seven and one half tons of Ferro-Fibrous Armor, the most protection this 'Mech has had at any time in its history. Furthermore, this is the first Vulcan to feature hand actuators. The new design features a Diverse Optics Extended Range Large Laser in the right torso and replaces the traditional arm-mounted Flamer with two Magna Medium Lasers, giving this Vulcan the punch to take on vehicles and light 'Mechs. A quartet of Magna Mk II Small Pulse Lasers fits snugly into the left arm; power conduits for this accurate anti-personnel array are routed along the same channel once used to feed that arm's single Machine Gun.",
