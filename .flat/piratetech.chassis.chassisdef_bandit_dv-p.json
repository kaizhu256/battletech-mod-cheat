  "Details": "While the primitive Dervish 1S was decommissioned from military use throughout the Inner Sphere by 2990s, it experienced a resurgence in the Periphery in the civilian sector. The Dervish 1S-F is a makeshift design initially cobbled together from scrap heaps but later produced as a standard variant on low-tech worlds. Primarily designed to start controlled fires in remote areas, the loadout of the 1S heavily favors incendiary weapons. With a top speed of only 64 km/h the unit cannot out-run fires, so the cockpit is designed with additional heat shielding and environment controls. The limited jump range of 120 meters is sufficient to navigate ravines and other natural obstacles.  Due to the civilian control several units have fallen into pirate or rebel hands and are used as makeshift terror platforms. Frequently used for extortion, the design has come to be known as the 'Bandit' through those areas where it remains common.",
