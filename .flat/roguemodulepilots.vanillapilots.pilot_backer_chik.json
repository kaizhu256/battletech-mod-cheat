  "Details": "Paradox — only his father calls him Edward — grew up on Tharkad in the Lyran Commonwealth, in the very heart of civilization. From an early age, he was fascinated by history, especially epic BattleMech battles and legends of Lostech.\r\n\r\nHe drifted through school and eventually settled into a concentration on history and political science, focusing on the motivations and impacts of the Succession Wars. A student broadcasting project became a launch point for a moderately successful series of historical programs he co-hosted.\r\n\r\nAfter an extended tour of the Inner Sphere, he was tapped as one of a team of hosts on a new historical program about BattleMechs and LosTech: his childhood dream come back again — and this time he was able to get up close and personal with 'Mechs.\r\n\r\nParadox then leveraged the hands-on experience from his second show into a third documentary show set on Solaris VII. This one was not a success, which was unfortunate for all the sponsors, and for Paradox's own savings. After he burned his bridges with one too many inflammatory remarks about his colleagues, he vanished from the public eye and eventually turned up in the Periphery, working as a mercenary pilot.",
