  "Details": "Michael Dark was born on Coventry in the Lyran Commonwealth, the son of an overseer of Coventry Metal Works. He worked hard in school and graduated from the Coventry Military Academy near the top of his class. He was then assigned to the LCAD Sixth Guards on Hesperus II, where he saw combat against Wolf's Dragoons.\r\n\r\nAfter his tour with LCAF was up, he chose to become a mercenary. Early in his mercenary career, he met Cecilia Bowens, who was serving as a MechTech and general support staff for the second company he worked for. They fell in love and married, but as they both enjoyed the mercenary lifestyle they decided to stay in the business. Now they have two children, Hugh and Julie, and Michael Dark often pitches his family to prospective employers as a package deal. Although children are unusual on a mercenary Dropship, his are well-trained and manage to make themselves useful. They're cute, too. It tends to be a good bargain.",
