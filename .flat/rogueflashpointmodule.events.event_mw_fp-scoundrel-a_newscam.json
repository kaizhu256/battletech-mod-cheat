You must know that. So I just had to bring you this opportunity that could benefit us both.\"\r\n\r\nShe continues as if you'd agreed. \"You have a MechWarrior in your employ, goes by the callsign [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]]. {TGT_MW.Gender?Male:He's|Female:She's|NonBinary:They're} the spitting image of a certain Davion official who has access to a Mydron research facility I'd very much like to see the inside of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me borrow {TGT_MW.OBJ} for a few weeks. If you play along, I'll give you one of whatever I find in there. What do you say? Partners?\"",
