  "Details": "Risenki Ariamaki was born on a merchant ship in the Outworld Alliance, to an extended family of tinkers and traders that spent far more time traveling between systems than planet-side. He grew up learning almost all of the trades associated with spacefaring merchants, but was far better working with his hands than bartering with customers.\r\n\r\nFor many years, he felt he had nothing to complain of as one of the younger members of a very large family. However, as the oldest generation began passing away, Risenki found himself being drawn into the more complicated squabbles of the new generation of leaders. He hadn't minded obeying the dictates of his grandparents and great-aunts. But his aunts and uncles would hand him responsibility and then countermand his instructions to his juniors, then berate him when things didn't turn out as they wished. This was simply not t the life he wished to lead.\r\n\r\nSo, after much thought, he struck out on his own. He had some trouble finding work outside of the connections of his family, and at last washed up on Solaris VII. Here, he found there was always work in one of the gladiatorial stables. When they put him in a BattleMech, he further found they were far easier to pilot that he'd expected. However, he was not of a warrior mindset, and as soon as his contract with his stable was completed, they let him go.\r\n\r\nHe returned to wandering. However, he now had skills that were always in demand among the mercenary companies of the Periphery. While he could not shine in gladiatorial combat, he enjoys working as part of a mercenary lance. He gets instructions, and he works with his 'Mech to accomplish his task, and all is well. Well, for him. Not so much for those he steps on.",
