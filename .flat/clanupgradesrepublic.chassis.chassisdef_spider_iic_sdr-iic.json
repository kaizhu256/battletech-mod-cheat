  "Details": "A fast skirmisher and scout, the Spider IIC is a mixtech unit designed with the best technology the Imperio posses. Designed to be hard to hit and harder to kill, the SDR-IIC is capable of ground speeds in excess of 120KPH and can jump a full 240 meters in a single bound. Armed with 6 ER Small Lasers and a pair of Improved Heavy Small Lasers, the IIC is a nasty infighter, capable of catching and holding heavier units in place until support arrives. A pair of Rocket Launcher 20’s provides a one shot punch for emergencies and a Guardian ECM suite interfers with enemy targeting systems. The use of locally made Rocket Launchers and imported Inner Sphere XL Engines help to keep the production costs down and there is expectation that the current output rate could soon increase as this mech goes into full time production.
