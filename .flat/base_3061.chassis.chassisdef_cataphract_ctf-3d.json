  "Details": "The longest ranged weapon carried by the CTF-3D Cataphract is a General Motors Nova-5 Ultra AC-5 in its right arm, boasting a rate of fire twice that of a standard autocannon. This is backed up by a Mydron Excel LB-X Autocannon/10 in its right torso, capable of firing both solid and cluster rounds. It is a more popular weapon than the Ultra AC-5, especially for use in an anti-conventional and anti-aircraft role without the possibility of jamming. Finally, the 'Mech has four Intek Medium Lasers for close range defense, one in each arm firing forward and two in its torso covering the rear. With only two tons of ammo for the LB-X 10 and one ton for the Ultra, if it runs dry the Cataphract must fall back to be reloaded before continuing the fight. Eleven tons of armor combined with CASE allowed the Cataphract to easily absorb damage. Sixteen heat sinks keep it cool while four HildCo Model 12 jump jets gave it a jumping distance of one hundred and twenty meters. Room for these improvements was made by using a GM 280 XL Engine.",
