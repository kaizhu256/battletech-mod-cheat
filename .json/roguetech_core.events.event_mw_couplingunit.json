I can try to patch around it, but I'm not sure that will work.\r\n\r\n\"What I'd prefer to do is have someone go EVA to perform the repair. [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] has plenty of experience with external ship work, and is ready to attempt the fix. Now, it's a bit risky, and I know how you value your MechWarriors. I'd like your call before I authorize the repair.\"",
