  "Details": "The Godfrey family was once originally a cadet branch of a ruling Federated Suns family, but before Joshua Godfrey's birth, they emigrated to the Capellan Confederation and purchased citizenship and Sheng titles there. Joshua, as the pampered youngest son of a large family, was gently guided through all childhood challenges, and encouraged to find something he enjoyed that would support the rest of the family in their political and business affairs.\r\n\r\nWhile he was at Sian University, though, tragedy struck. A decades-old grudge had resurfaced to punish his family for their defection from the Federated Suns. While the culprit was an old business rival and the ultimate motivation financial gain, the damage was the same. Joshua's parents and eldest siblings were all assassinated in a single horrifying week - and the Liao would make no response except polite sounds of commiseration.\r\n\r\nAgainst the advice - and pleadings - of his remaining brother and sister, Joshua left the university before graduation. Recalling a childhood fascination with BattleMechs, he traveled to the Periphery to find an apprenticeship as a MechWarrior. He fully intends on learning the ins and outs of the mercenary trade, and then leading a command of his own home again, there to defend what remains of his family.",
