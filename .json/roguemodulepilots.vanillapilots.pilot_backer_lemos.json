  "Age": "35",
  "Callsign": "Sabrewolf",
  "Details": "Sabrewolf — he never uses 'Zebak Koga' -- was born to explorers of the Periphery who simply didn't return one day from one of their expeditions. At least that's the story he was told. Perhaps they died, or perhaps they decided a child was an unwanted burden. He was passed around the small community his parents had been using as a base until he was old enough to send off to school, at which point he was promptly given to a passing mercenary company. 'Apprenticed,' they called it. He does not say the name of the company, except to observe, with dark glee, that they no longer exist.\r\n\r\nAfter escaping his original company as a young man, he continued to seek employment as a mercenary, first as ground support for BattleMech lances, and then as a BattleMech pilots. He has had many commanders, and does not always leave with good reports. Insubordination is a common complaint. It's not that he's rude. It's just that if he disapproves of a mission, or how it's being carried out, he will instead enact his own plan. But somehow, he stays alive and brings his 'Mech back, which is valuable enough in a pilot.",
