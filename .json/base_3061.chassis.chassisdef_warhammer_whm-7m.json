Built around a Magna 280 fusion engine, the 7M had a top speed of 64.5 km/h and carried eighteen double heat sinks to handle the waste heat generated by its two Fusigon Longtooth ER PPCs. Backing up these new weapons were two Martell medium lasers in the side torsos and a Shannon SH-60 SRM-6 launcher over the right shoulder. A LFN Lindblad machine gun was carried in the right torso, while the left mounted an LFN Lindblad Shotgun Anti-Missile System.
