  "Details": "Standing at ten meters tall, the Watchman is a 'Mech that was born of necessity. The idea for the design came when the bulk of the AFFS was moved to the Clan front. Because this seriously undermined the ability of the Federated Suns to keep its borders secure, the Watchman was designed to be distributed to militia units within the border marches to bulk up their strength. In its own right the Watchman is a durable and reliable 'Mech that is built with off the shelf components and is very easy to repair. The 'Mech is armored with eight and a half tons of standard armor, has a top speed of 86.4 km/h, and can jump up to one hundred and fifty meters. This, combined with the Watchman's varied arsenal, makes it an excellent trooper or trainer.",
