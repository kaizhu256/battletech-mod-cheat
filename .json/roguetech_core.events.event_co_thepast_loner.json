It's not like on the Holovids.\"\r\n\r\nOut of the corner your eye, you scan the group, and it's like you're gazing into your own past. Three young nobles casually stare in your direction, pampered and comfortable. Written all over their eager faces is a feeling you remember too well: looking for an escape from their safe, predictable lives.",
