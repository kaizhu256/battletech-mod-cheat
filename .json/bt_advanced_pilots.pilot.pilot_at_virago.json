  "Age": "26",

  "Details": "Virago hails from the other side of the Sphere, and from the wrong side of the war. At least, that's what everyone, including her, says. She makes most folk uneasy with her size and her origins in equal measure, as she's a veteran of the Clan Jade Falcon invasion force. An Elemental, to be precise. How it is she ended up in the Rimward Periphery looking for a mercenary outfit is anyone's guess, but broken noses and worse are the typical fate of those who ask. Might be a worthwhile mercenary hidden in there behind all the odd mannerisms and patterns of speech. Clan lingo is weird, to say the least, and that's not even going into their abhorrence of contractions. Makes an odd duck odder in a place as frontiersy as the Periphery.\r\n\r\nAs she tells it, she's been working as an exoskeleton operator in cargo bays to make ends meet, but she's tired of being out of the fight, and wants a shot at real combat again. Barfights, apparently, don't appeal when you're a head taller than the next biggest person in the room.",
