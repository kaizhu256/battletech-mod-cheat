  "Details": "The establishment of the Escorpion Imperrio left the Goliath Scorpions with large quantities of sub par equipment and a desperate need to fill the holes in their depleted Touman. Finding themselves with a large quantity of Firestarter FS9-H’s, the decision was taken to outfit them as second line mechs for the new Garrison caste. Designed to serve alongside the hodgepodge mix of MilitaMechs and IIC’s that formed the back bone of both the Solhamma formations and the Garrison caste unit’s; the GS is a cheap upgrade capable of surprising it’s opponents. Fielding a mix of ER Flamers and a pair of Improved Heavy Medium Lasers, backed up by a pair of Light LMG’s; the weapons load out resembles the FS9-A more than the FS9-H. Currently only two dozen of these mechs exist, but with the sheer amount found in Imperrio stockpiles, there is no plan to slow down production anytime soon.",
