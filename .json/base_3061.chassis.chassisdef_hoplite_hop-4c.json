Intended for infantry support, the Hoplite is slow for a medium 'Mech with a top speed of only 64.8 km/h. However its eleven and a half tons of armor and heavy arsenal, both impressive for a 'Mech of its size, makes the Hoplite a rugged machine able to fight its way out of most situations using superior firepower. Effectively identical to the original Hoplite, the 4C carries as its primary weapon a Luxor HV Autocannon/10, which allows it to put a good amount of damage on a target, with a low amount of heat. The 'Mech is also armed with a Conan/5 LRM-5 launcher. Arriving with the Wolf's Dragoons, these were the first Hoplites seen in the Inner Sphere since their extinction during the Succession Wars.",
