  "Details": "Although Klyst hasn't seen much real battlefield action, she has a solid experience of 'Mech warfare from her time in the Solaris Games, where she fought as a renowned lone gladiator through multiple seasons. A relentless warrior with a lone wolf mind whose out-of-the-box thinking surprised more than one gladiator team, she favors mobility and firepower over protection - Medium and Heavy 'Mechs packing a punch and jump jets are her thing, although she won't give the cold-shoulder to Assault-class 'Mechs... as long as they are fitted with jump jets.",
