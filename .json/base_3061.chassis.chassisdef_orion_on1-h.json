A newly developed Class-10 Prototype Autocannon was installed and two tons of ammo in place of the AC/5. This was backed up by two 5-tube Long-Range Missile launchers with one ton of reloads in the left torso for striking enemies at range and a short-range SRM-4 missile launcher and a ton of ammunition installed in the left arm for close-in defense. It was also heavily protected by 21 tons of armor. A minimal amount of heatsinks, however, could cause build-up of heat within crippling levels, but could be avoided by competent MechWarriors.",
