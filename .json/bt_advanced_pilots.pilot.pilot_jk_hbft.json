That is not to say he wasn't familiar with the violence of living on the fringes of the Inner Sphere. With All Dawn being on the outskirts of Steiner-controlled territory, he was no stranger to regular harassment from pirates.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of increasingly brutal raids on their settlement, Nathan finally worked up the courage to defend his home.  Rallying together a local militia, they managed to give the raiders a taste of their own medicine with improvised explosives made from one of the most ready resources on the world, fertilizer.  But victory would prove to be pyrrhic.  Upon returning to his farm he found that the pirates had set fire to his farmhouse with all of his little fuzzy friends inside.\r\n\r\nIn light of such a loss, Nathan picked up what few belongings remained to him and left to join a small-time mercenary outfit where he endeavored to shape himself into the bulwark upon which Hell itself would break.\r\n\r\nIn memoriam of his lost friends and the hope and joy that Nathan  believed they brought to the world, he took on the callsign: HBFT (Happy Bunny Fluffy Toes.",
